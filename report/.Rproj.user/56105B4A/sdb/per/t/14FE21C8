Public schools are available universally. The funding and control of public schools are done by state, local and federal government. Their curricula and staffing are decided by the locally elected school boards. On the other hand, private schools are generally free to determine their own curricula and staffing policies. There are also charter schools, which receive public funding but operate independently. Some states do not have charter school authorization. Around 88\\% of school-aged students attend public schools, 9\\% attend private schools and rest 3\\% are homeschooled. \n\\\\Education in the United States is compulsory over an age range, which varies from state to state. Formal education is divided into a number of stages. Children may begin with pre-kindergarten, kindergarten or first grade. The compulsory education is till 12th grade, after that students can pursue higher education in colleges or universities. Schools are divided into three groups- elementary school, middle or junior high school and high school. The American school year traditionally begins at the end of August, after a summer recess. \n\\\\The data are collected from the National Center for Education Statistics for the number of schools, students, and teachers in regular schools with membership for the 100 largest cities in the United States, by school operational and charter status and state for school years ending 2001 through 2011. Here, the data from Chicago, IL among the 100 largest cities in the United States has been chosen for analysis.\n\n\n\\section {Data}\nWe have to collect data for examining the total numbers of schools, teachers and schools in Chicago, IL over the period of 10 years, from December, 2011 to December, 2011. We will get the required data from the Quandl API. We will be using various libraries available in R like RCurl, ggplot2 and reshape2.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Obtaing the data.\n\nThere are many ways to download data into R. We will be using RCurl. It is a laborious but a good way to download data from a secure URL using getURL command in the RCurl package. We will also use read.csv and textConnection command, which are available in base R.\n\n<<chunk1>>=\n\n# Loading RCurl\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(Quandl)\n\n# To download data from a secure URL using RCurl\n\nmyData <- Quandl(\"NCES/SCHOOLS_CITIES_CHICAGOILLINOIS\",\n                 authcode=\"sUMBj-Lb7MRzwnUWXvxe\")\n\n@\n\\item Cleaning data \n \nCleaning data is the most time taking job. We will scrub and clean our data to get only the relevant data needed to obtain the results. Irrelevant data makes the analyis difficult. By scanning the data, we came to know that we only need column 1 through column 4. Therefore, we will choose and store all rows containing only these columns in new variable called cleanData. For further analysis, we will be using cleanData variable only. We will also change the colunms' name for convenience.\n\n<<chunk2>>=\n# Filtering the data needed to plot a graph showing total \n#students, total teachers and total schools in Chicago, Illinois\ncleanData<-myData[,1:4]\n# Changing the columns' name\ncolnames(cleanData) <- c(\"year\", \"schools\", \"students\", \"teachers\")\n# Showing the contents of cleanData\ncleanData\n@\n\\item Explore data\n\nWe will explore the data by using three commands - class(), str(), summary().\nThe function class prints the vector of names of classes an object inherits from.\nThe function str compactly displays the internal structure of an R object, a diagonistic function and an   alternative to summary.\nAnd the summary is a generic function to produce result summaries of the results of various model functions.\n\n<<>>=\n# Class\nclass(cleanData)\n\n# Str\nstr(cleanData)\n\n# Summary\nsummary(cleanData)\n@\n\n\n\n\\end {enumerate}\n\n\\section {Result}\n\nWe will plot a line graph from the data using the ggplot2 package. For doing this, first we have to melt to data using the melt command in the reshape2 package.\n\n<<chunk3, fig=TRUE>>=\n# Melting the data\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(reshape2)\nmoltenData <- melt(cleanData,id.vars=\"year\")\nggplot(moltenData, aes(as.Date(year,\"%e %b %Y\"),value))+ \n  geom_line(aes(color = variable))+\n   geom_point()  + xlab(\"Year\") + \n  labs(title = \"Graph\")+ theme_bw() \n@\n \nThe graph is havong three lines showing\n\\end{document}",
